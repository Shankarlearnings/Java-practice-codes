ðŸ“˜ What is Inheritance in Java?
Inheritance is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class (child/subclass) to acquire properties and behaviors (fields and methods) from another class (parent/superclass).

It promotes code reuse, modularity, and helps establish a hierarchical relationship between classes.

ðŸ§  Key Concepts of Inheritance:
Term	Description
Superclass (Parent)	The class whose members are inherited.
Subclass (Child)	The class that inherits from another class.
        extends keyword	Used to declare inheritance.
Reusability	Reuse fields and methods of existing classes.
Method Overriding	Subclass can redefine a method from the parent.
        super keyword	Used to call the parent class's constructor or method.

** If I want to   write encapsulation to this the below is the code with encapsulation

public class Employee extends Person {
    String jobTitle;

    public void work() {
        // Accessing name using getName() because name is private in Person
        System.out.println(getName() + " is working as a " + jobTitle);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp = new Employee();

        // Setting private fields using setters
        emp.setName("Alice");
        emp.setAge(30);

        emp.jobTitle = "Software Developer";

        emp.introduce();  // Still works, it uses internal access
        emp.work();       // Uses getName() to access private name
    }
}*/
